        <b>Who is Dwight Schrute?</b>
      </p>

Dwight is an all around man who loves to work hard whether that is at his farm or in the office selling paper.</p>

        <ul class="Educaton-section">
          <p>Dwight's upbringing on the Beet Farm allowed for quite a bit of learning. Having been homeschooled most of his life he aquired skills that other students could only dream of. He was never bullied because he could easily take down anyone who was attempting to do him harm. He was the smartest in his class of three. By the age of two he was fluent in both English and Old German. He had memorized the periodic table elements by 7 and could do calculus by the age of 12.  </p>
          <P>Because of Dwight's clearly advanced skills in all scholarly areas he decided he would take his chances at

                 Penn State Shenango
              </li>
            </a>
          He found he was smarter than every person on campus and Graduated with a Triple Major in Business, German, and Survival. He was actually the first and last student to ever do so. (No one else wants to run through fire.)
